            <h1>Your Story</h1>
            <blockquote id="christmas" class="story" style="display: none;">Every Christmas we <span class="verb"></span> to a <span class="adjective"></span> tree farm far away. This is not just any <span class="adjective"></span> tree farm. My dad and I <span class="verb"></span> onto the <span class="noun"></span> to <span class="verb"></span> for the perfect <span class="noun"></span>. Some people like them <span class="adjective"></span>, but I prefer them <span class="adjective"></span>. After  searching for hours I usually <span class="adverb"></span> exclaim "Dad! The perfect tree is over there!" Off we <span class="verb"></span> to get the tree. The problem is we always forget the <span class="noun"></span> and the <span class="noun"></span>. But at the end of the day we <span class="adverb"></span> get the tree and head home <span class="adverb"></span>. "I wish it was Christmas all year round" I <span class="adverb"></span> think to myself.</blockquote>
            <blockquote id="shopping" class="story" style="display: none;">Today I went shopping. When I arrived at the store I saw a   <span class="adjective"></span>     <span class="noun"></span>, who upon noticing me    <span class="adverb"></span>   said "I need to   <span class="verb"></span>  ". "Well,   that was   <span class="adjective"></span>  " I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it\s inventory, so I felt    <span class="adverb"></span>   lost. I   walked up to store clerk and said    <span class="adverb"></span>   "I am looking for a   <span class="adjective"></span>     <span class="noun"></span>   that doesnâ€™t    <span class="verb"></span>   as often as the last one I had." The store clerk    looked at me with a   <span class="adjective"></span>   look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the   <span class="noun"></span>  , if you see a   <span class="noun"></span>   that    <span class="adverb"></span> can <span class="verb"></span> , then you've gone too far." As I tried to understand his directions, I thought to myself, "I should have just ordered it    on amazon.com. Their products seem to    <span class="verb"></span>   the perfect amount."</blockquote>
            <blockquote id="brainstorm" class="story" style="display: none;">Many say that brainstorming is   <span class="adjective"></span>   and does not   <span class="verb"></span>. However, with the combination of the right computer and   <span class="noun"></span>   anyone  can lead a good    <span class="verb"></span>  . When you have    <span class="adverb"></span>   pulled together a   <span class="adjective"></span>      group of   <span class="noun"></span>   in a big room with lots of TV\s then  magical things will happen. In the past we have    <span class="adverb"></span>   suggested  participants work together to find the most   <span class="adjective"></span>   solution. The   most difficult part is many   <span class="adjective"></span>     <span class="noun"></span>   like to   <span class="verb"></span> . This has proved to be    <span class="adverb"></span>   problematic.  But in the end the most important   <span class="noun"></span>   usually is brought to light.  Typically we try to encourage ideas to    <span class="verb"></span>  , and never shut ideas  down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for    <span class="adverb"></span>   listening!</blockquote>
