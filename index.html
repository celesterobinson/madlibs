My dad and I    (Verb)   onto the   (noun)   to    (Verb)   for the perfect   (noun)  .  Some people like them   (Adjectives)  , but I prefer them   (Adjectives)  . After  searching for hours I usually   (adverb)   exclaim "Dad! The perfect tree is over   there!" Off we    (Verb)   to get the tree. The problem is we always forget the  (noun)   and the  (noun)  . But at the end of the day we    (adverb)   get the tree and head home    (adverb)  . "I wish it was Christmas all year round"  I    (adverb)   think to myself.</blockquote>
            <blockquote id="shopping" class="story" style="display: none;">Today I went shopping. When I arrived at the store I saw a   (Adjectives)     (noun)  , who upon noticing me    (adverb)   said "I need to   (Verb)  ". "Well,   that was   (Adjectives)  " I thought to myself and walked in the store. The store had rearranged it\s inventory, so I felt    (adverb)   lost. I   walked up to store clerk and said    (adverb)   "I am looking for a   (Adjectives)     (noun)   that doesnâ€™t    (Verb)   as often as the last one I had." The store clerk    looked at me with a   (Adjectives)   look in his eye and said, "What you are looking for can be found by the   (noun)  , if you see a   (noun)   that    (adverb)   can    (Verb)  , then you've gone too far."

            <blockquote id="brainstorm" class="story" style="display: none;">Many say that brainstorming is   (Adjectives)   and does not   (Verb)  . However, with the combination of the right computer and   (noun)   anyone  can lead a good    (Verb)  . When you have    (adverb)   pulled together a   (Adjectives)      group of   (noun)   in a big room with lots of TV\s then  magical things will happen. In the past we have    (adverb)   suggested  participants work together to find the most   (Adjectives)   solution. The   most difficult part is many   (Adjectives)     (noun)   like to   (Verb) . This has proved to be    (adverb)   problematic.  But in the end the most important   (noun)   usually is brought to light.  Typically we try to encourage ideas to    (Verb)  , and never shut ideas  down. This concludes our instructions. Thanks for    (adverb)   listening!</blockquote>
